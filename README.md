# Automated_WorkIntructions
This is the repo for a small project I have built to help the Quality Engineering Dept. with managing and updating Work Instructions for quality inspectors.

Some of the key features are:
 1. Scrape part data from old work instructions.
 2. Insert part data into new work instruction template found in resources folder.
 3. Save new work instruction in the correct directory and under the proper name.
 4. Create a QR code from a PDF version of the work instruction. 
    (The instructions need to be saved to the cloud so that they are accessible when scaned)


As of right now this is still a work in progress but I have implemented the first and last features as of right now.
I am currently working on the rest of the project.
